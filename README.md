# üé® Moodscape - Your Generative Audio Environment

**Describe the world you want to hear. Moodscape translates your words into a living, breathing audio-visual experience.**

Moodscape is a generative art project built for the **"Speaking with Machines"** hackathon. It's an exploration of a post-UI internet where conversations and intent replace clicks and menus. Instead of a traditional interface, your only input is a description of a mood, a feeling, or a place. The application then generates a unique, non-repeating ambient soundscape and a multi-layered visual scene to match.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Truly Generative Experience:** Every prompt creates a completely unique world. The background image, animated overlay, and combination of sounds are all generated on-the-fly by AI. No two creations are exactly alike.
*   **Hybrid Visual Engine:** Moodscape uses a sophisticated, multi-layered approach to visuals:
    *   **AI-Generated Art:** A beautiful, high-fidelity background image is generated by **Pollinations.ai** to match the aesthetic of your prompt (e.g., "lofi anime style," "Ghibli-inspired").
    *   **Dynamic Animation Overlay:** A transparent `p5.js` canvas is layered on top, featuring a custom, AI-generated animation (e.g., falling rain, drifting embers, sparkling fireflies) created by **Google Gemini**.
*   **Immersive Audio Engine:** Using the native Web Audio API, Moodscape fetches a custom set of sounds selected by Gemini and plays them in non-repeating, slightly offset loops to create a natural and evolving ambient soundscape.
*   **Gesture-Based Interaction:** In line with the "No UI" rule, all interaction is gestural. A simple **long-press** on the screen is all that's needed to clear the current scene and create a new one.
